# Kekchain Vault Factory && Kekchain Vaults
An all new kVF // kV protocols to handle payments and distribution for KsB aka Kekchain Sacred Bridge

## Made with <3 by Team Interchained
A Granted & Licensed fork of I-Vault. Perfected for KsB. 

## Requirements
Solidity 0.8.13

## Problem
No known ERC compliant standard or protocol simply handles secure payments and distribution for groups/teams/communities.

## Solution
VaultFactory manages deployment of Vaults based around a team authentication layer, which combines the use of ERC20 & ETH, and a splitter. 

## Early-Stage Implementations (pre-release)
Deployed to:
Ropsten: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x42c21Ec24cBFF9b010F50a8D1dD44b049783EF3A

Kekchain: https://testnet-explorer.kekchain.com/address/0xfC9A4D96D405eBb81d0bd0951bA7e5c631771D10

Including many features such as:

**Calls from KekchainVaultFactory to KekchainVault(x)** 
- **AUTH**: Multi-user Auth() layer (introduces an all new style of decentralized "ownable")
- **deployVaults**: Deploy iVaults (bulk)
- **fundVault/fundVaults**: Fund iVaults in ether (solo && bulk)
- **balanceOf**: Check iVault(x) balance in native ether/kek (solo)
- **balanceOfToken**: Check iVault(x) balance in token (solo)
- **balanceOfVaults**: Check iVaults balances in ether or token (bulk)
- **wrapVault**: Wrap iVaults ether balance to WETH/WKEK (solo)
- **withdrawTokenFrom**/**batchVaultRange**: Withdraw ERC20 tokens from iVaults (bulk && solo)
- **withdrawFrom**/**batchVaultRange**: Withdraw native coin (ether/KEK) from iVaults (bulk && solo)
- **withdraw**: {simultaneous} Deploy an iVault && Transfer native coin (ether/KEK) from VaultFactory to deployed iVault && Withdraw balance from deployed iVault (solo)
- **withdrawToken**: {simultaneous} Deploy an iVault && Transfer ERC20 (token) from VaultFactory to the deployed iVault && Withdraw the ERC20 from deployed iVault (solo)
- **receive**//**fallback**: {simultaneous} Send native coin (ether/KEK) to VaultFactory. On receive()... Auto-Deploy an iVault && Auto-Fund deployed iVault (solo)
- **withdrawFundsFromVaultTo**: Withdraw native coin (ether/KEK) from iVault to alt-receiver, replace pre-authorized wallet (required sender must be the wallet to replace)
- **indexOfWallet**: iVault wallet address to Vault Index
- **walletOfIndex**: iVault index to wallet address 
- **safeAddr**: Safety check to detect && enforce prevention of funding/calling to or on a dead address (i.e. wallet does not exist in VaultMap index)


**Calls to KekchainVault(x)** 
- **setShards**: alter community funding percentage, switch token funding on/off
- **setCommunity**: change community wallet address FromWallet to toWallet (including authorization status)
- **setDevelopment**: change development wallet address FromWallet to toWallet (including authorization status)
- **vaultDebt**: returns an operator or member coinAmountOwed, tokenAmountOwed, wkekAmountOwed, coinAmountDrawn, tokenAmountDrawn, as well as the total lifetime tokenDeposited, and coinDepostied
- **deposit**: triggers splitAndStore, increments tokenDeposited and coinDeposited
- **splitAndStore**: increments member coinAmountDeposited, and community/development coinAmountOwed, tokenAmountOwed, wkekAmountOwed (detects coin/token/WETH/customToken)
- **split**: splits an amount of liquidity following preset (setShards adjustable) conditions
- **tokenizeWETH**: tokenize an iVaults native ether/kek balance to WETH/WKEK
- **withdraw**: split, and withdraw an iVault(x) balance in native ether/kek to community/development 
- **withdrawToken**: split, and withdraw an iVault(x) token balance to community/development 
- **synced**: enforce iVault token balance is synchronized as a pre-transfer out correction. (ex. someone sent token to the contract, and did not call deposit)
- **transfer**: splits and transfers out native ether/KEK to an alternate receiver address (ex. community wants to draw native coin ether/KEK from an iVault to a different address than the preset variable.
